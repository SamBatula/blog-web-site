# Rate My Class Site

# Introduction

As seniors, we’ve taken most core classes and quite a few upper level divisions in Syracuse University’s Computer Science curriculum. From there, Rate My Course was born. It would be a platform for SU students to find reviews and resources for CS classes. The goal for this project was to deliver reviews of courses to students who needed more of an idea of which classes were difficult and challenging by the professor. Students do not always have a friend who took the classes they want or need to take, so this website would solve this pain point for that user. We had our goal, user groups, pain points and solution. In addition, this would be a website for consolidated information with reviews from students to ensure the course aligns with your interests. The product lifecycle is continuously implementing change to the constraints and roadblocks ahead. Rate My Course delivers what we have not seen on campus, yet can be closely related to competing websites like Rate My Professor, however it is uniquely for Syracuse University students. In our website, we featured blog posts of opinion columns of CS classes at Syracuse University from current seniors including ratings in order to make prospective students have a better understanding of the courses.

After installing packages. The firebase console should work as my credentials are still on the app. I am using the free version of firebase so there are some limitation to the app.
